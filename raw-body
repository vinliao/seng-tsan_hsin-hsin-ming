The Great Way is not difficult<br />
for those who have no preferences.<br />
When love and hate are both absent<br />
everything becomes clear and undisguised.<br />
Make the smallest distinction, however,<br />
and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.<br />
<br />
If you wish to see the truth<br />
then hold no opinions for or against anything.<br />
To set up what you like against what you dislike<br />
is the disease of the mind.<br />
When the deep meaning of things is not understood,<br />
the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.<br />
<br />
The Way is perfect like vast space<br />
where nothing is lacking and nothing in excess.<br />
Indeed, it is due to our choosing to accept or reject<br />
that we do not see the true nature of things.<br />
<br />
Live neither in the entanglements of outer things,<br />
nor in inner feelings of emptiness.<br />
Be serene in the oneness of things and such<br />
erroneous views will disappear by themselves.<br />
<br />
When you try to stop activity by passivity<br />
your very effort fills you with activity.<br />
As long as you remain in one extreme or the other<br />
you will never know Oneness.<br />
<br />
Those who do not live in the single Way<br />
fail in both activity and passivity,<br />
assertion and denial.<br />
To deny the reality of things<br />
is to miss their reality;<br />
To assert the emptiness of things<br />
is to miss their reality.<br />
<br />
The more you talk and think about it,<br />
the further astray you wander from the truth.<br />
Stop talking and thinking,<br />
and there is nothing you will not be able to know.<br />
<br />
To return to the root is to find meaning,<br />
but to pursue appearances is to miss the source.<br />
At the moment of inner enlightenment<br />
there is a going beyond appearance and emptiness.<br />
The changes that appear to occur in the empty world<br />
we call real only because of our ignorance.<br />
<br />
Do not search for the truth;<br />
only cease to cherish opinions.<br />
do not remain in the dualistic state.<br />
Avoid such pursuits carefully.<br />
If there is even a trace of this and that,<br />
of right and wrong,<br />
the mind-essence ewill be lost in confusion.<br />
<br />
Although all dualities come from the One,<br />
do not be attached even to this One.<br />
When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,<br />
nothing in the world can offend.<br />
And when a thing can no longer offend,<br />
it ceases to exist in the old way.<br />
<br />
When no discriminating thoughts arise,<br />
the old mind ceases to exist.<br />
When thought objects vanish,<br />
the thinking-subject vanishes:<br />
As when the mind vanishes, objects vanish.<br />
<br />
Things are objects because of the subject (mind):<br />
the mind (subject) is such because of things (object).<br />
Understand the relativity of these two<br />
and the basic reality: the unity of emptiness.<br />
In this Emptiness the two are indistinguishable<br />
and each contains in itself the whole world.<br />
If you do not discriminate between coarse and fine<br />
you will not be tempted to prejudice and opinion.<br />
<br />
To live in the Great Way is neither easy nor difficult.<br />
But those with limited views are fearful and irresolute:<br />
the faster they hurry, the slower they go.<br />
And clinging (attachment) cannot be limited:<br />
Even to be attached to the idea of enlightenment<br />
is to go astray.<br />
Just let things be in their own way<br />
and there will be neither coming not going.<br />
Obey the nature of things (your own nature)<br />
and you will walk freely and undisturbed.<br />
<br />
When the thought is in bondage the truth is hidden<br />
for everything is murky and unclear.<br />
And the burdensome practice of judging<br />
brings annoyance and weariness.<br />
What benefit can be derived<br />
from distinctions and separations?<br />
<br />
If you wish to move in the One Way<br />
do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas.<br />
Indeed, to accept them fully<br />
is identical with enlightenment.<br />
<br />
The wise man strives to no goals<br />
but the foolish man fetters himself.<br />
<br />
There is one Dharma, not many.<br />
Distinctions arise<br />
from the clinging needs of the ignorant.<br />
To seek Mind with the (discriminating) mind<br />
is the greatest of all mistakes.<br />
<br />
Rest and unrest derive from illusion;<br />
with enlightenment<br />
there is no liking and disliking.<br />
All dualities come from ignorant inference.<br />
They are like dreams or flowers in air -<br />
foolish to try to grasp them.<br />
Gain and loss, right and wrong,<br />
such thoughts must<br />
finally be abolished at once.<br />
<br />
If the eye never sleeps,<br />
all dreams will naturally cease.<br />
If the mind makes no discriminations,<br />
the ten thousand things are as they are,<br />
of single essence.<br />
To understand the mystery of this One-essence<br />
is to be released from all entanglements.<br />
When all things are seen equally<br />
the timeless Self-essence is reached,<br />
No comparisons or analogies are possible<br />
in this causeless, relationless state.<br />
Consider movement stationary<br />
and the stationary in motion,<br />
both movement and rest disappear.<br />
When such dualities cease to exist<br />
Oneness itself cannot exist.<br />
To this ultimate finality<br />
no law or description applies.<br />
<br />
For the unified mind in accord with the way<br />
all self-centered striving ceases.<br />
Doubts and irresolutions vanish<br />
and life in true faith is possible.<br />
With a single stroke we are freed from bondage:<br />
Nothing clings to us and we hold to nothing.<br />
<br />
All is empty, clear, self-illuminating,<br />
with no exertion of the mind's power.<br />
Here thought, feeling,<br />
knowledge and imagination are of no value.<br />
<br />
In this world of suchness<br />
there is neither self nor other-than-self.<br />
To come directly into harmony with this reality<br />
just say when doubt rises "not two".<br />
In this "not two" nothing is separate,<br />
nothing is excluded.<br />
<br />
No matter when or where,<br />
enlightenment means entering this truth.<br />
And this truth is beyond extension<br />
or diminution in time and space:<br />
In it a single thought is ten thousand years.<br />
<br />
Emptiness here, emptiness there,<br />
but the infinite universe<br />
stands always before your eyes.<br />
Infinitely large and infinitely small;<br />
no difference, for definitions have vanished<br />
and no boundaries are seen.<br />
<br />
So too with Being and non-Being.<br />
Don't waste time in doubts and arguments<br />
That have nothing to do with this.<br />
<br />
One thing, all things,<br />
move among and intermingle without distinction.<br />
To live in this realization<br />
is to be without anxiety about non-perfection.<br />
To live in this faith is the road to non-duality,<br />
because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind.<br />
<br />
Words!<br />
The Way is beyond language,<br />
for in it there is<br />
no yesterday<br />
no tomorrow<br />
no today.<br />
<br />
